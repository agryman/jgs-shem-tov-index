<h1>Development Plan for Shem Tov Index</h1>

<address>Arthur Ryman, 2011-08-31</address>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Members of JGS have indexed all the articles in Shem Tov. 
The goal of this development project is to convert this index into web content.
Here are the deliverables:

<ul>

<li>Publish the index with articles in publication order as an html page.
The web page shall have a hyperlink to the issue of Shem Tov.
All issues of Shem Tov are published as pdf files in the Joomla DOCMAN component.
This has the benefit of giving members a place to look for articles.
To begin, they can simply search the page using the web browser text search.
This also makes the index searchable by Google.
</li>

<li>Publish a similar page sorted by subject.</li>

<li>Publish a similar page sorted by author.</li>

</ul>
